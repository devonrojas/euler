**Summary:**


The objective was to create a simple program to demonstrate Euler's Method for an ordinary differential equation. It was created using Python.

The program follows the algorithm for Euler's method, as defined below:
```
Step 1: define f(x)
Step 2: input initial values x and y
Step 3: input step size h and number of steps n
Step 4: output initial x and y values
Step 5: for i from 1 to n do:
Step 6: k = f(x)
        y = y + h * k
        x = x + h
Step 7: output x and y values
Step 8: end
```

In addition, the program also presents the user with a plot of the results of Euler's method, the evaluated original function, and the global truncation error between them.


Example Output:
