**Summary:**


The objective was to create a simple program to demonstrate Euler's Method for a first-order ordinary differential equation. I created this using Python. The program takes user input for the initial x and y values, the step size, and the ending x value.

It then follows the algorithm for Euler's method, as defined below:
```
Step 1: define f(x)
Step 2: input initial values x and y
Step 3: input step size h and number of steps n
Step 4: output initial x and y values
Step 5: for i from 1 to n do:
Step 6: k = f(x)
        y = y + h * k
        x = x + h
Step 7: output x and y values
Step 8: end
```
Example Output:
